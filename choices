Design decisions:

1.  The const keyword is not supported.
        - Const has poorly defined meaning in TS to begin with.

2.  Array types must be specified like so:
        let a : Array<string> = ['a','b','c']       // initalized array
        or
        let a : Array<string> = Array<string>(10);  // blank initalized array

3. There are no undefined variables:
        A variable takes on a '0' or 'blank' value if not specified but it is never undefined.
        This is because supporting union of type and undefined at runtime produces unwanted instruciton overhead.

4. Placing a $ symbol in front of a hook api call such as $param causes the hook to rollback if the call fails.
        Failing to place such a symbol causes the hook to continue executing on error...
        With global: errno being populated with the error code.

5. HookAPIs with a single output write buffer can be assigned to a variable of the appropriate type.
        For example:
            let i : int = hook_pos();
            let a : Account = util_raddr(hook_param("admin_addr"));
